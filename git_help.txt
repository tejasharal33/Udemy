git add "filename.txt": add files in staging area of git to commit new and modified files
git commit -m "some msg" : commit a record
git status : shows status as below -
    untracked - new file not on git hub yet
    modified - modified file locally
    staged - file is read yto commit
    unchanged/unmodified - not modified yet locally 

git add . : adds all files
git push origin main : upload local content to remote[github]
git push -u origin main : create a short form to  push by default to origin. using 'git push'
git init : new repo creation
git remote add origin <link> : push repository on github (need to create a github repo first)
git remote -v : to verify remote repository 
git branch : to check branch 
git branch -M main :  to rename branch

Workflow : Github Repo -> clone it to local -> changes -> add -> commit -> push

# branch
git branch : to check branch
git branch -M main : to rename branch
git checkout <- branch name-> : to navigate through branches
git checkout -b <- branch name-> : creates new branch
git branch -d <- branch name->

# merge branch

git diff <- branch name-> : to compare commits,branches,files & more
git merge <_ branch name-> : to merge 2 branches

create a PR : another way to merge using pull request on github

git pull origin main : fetch and download content form remote to local repo

# Resolve merge conflicts [unable to automatically resolve merge conflicts]

If you're using VSCode as your default editor, Git might open VSCode for you to write the commit message. After saving and closing the editor, Git will complete the commit.

If you're unsure how to proceed in the editor that opened, here's a general guide:

Insert Mode:
If you're in a text editor like Vim, you may need to press "i" to enter insert mode before typing your message.
Save and Exit:
After entering your commit message, save and exit the editor. In Vim, you can usually do this by pressing Esc to exit insert mode, then typing :wq and pressing Enter. For other editors, follow their respective save and exit commands.
If you prefer to provide the commit message directly in the terminal without opening an editor, you can use the -m option:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
